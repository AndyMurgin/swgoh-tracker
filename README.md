# swgoh-tracker

This is just a draft page about a little app which is going to become a Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes (SWGOH) mobile game tracker. This is supposed to be a Notification system for SWGOH players letting them know about important events in the game affecting their account or their Guild directly.

This is very beginning of development, so don't expect much. So far ;) You can find my current design proposal on this page: https://github.com/AndyMurgin/swgoh-tracker/wiki/Design-Evolution

Let me know in case of any questions or suggestions! See you soon!
